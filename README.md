# Annie-Appbot-Research-Assistant-Work-


* This is an Appbot Project I am working on in Integrated Media Systems Center Lab (IMSC) in USC.

* I am using frameworks like Ionic, Cordova & AngularJS to make the Mobile app. The app is being used to present the news in interactive manner to the audience.

* In a later phase I will be applying Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to enable bidirectional chat between user and appbot.




This is a starter template for Ionic projects.
How to use this template

This template does not work on its own. The shared files for each starter are found in the ionic2-app-base repo.

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the Starter App Base.
With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after ionic2-starter-, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the ionic start command below:

$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs

Then, to run it, cd into myTabs and run:

$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
